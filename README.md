Spam classification with LangGraph

Notebook is a part of AI Agent course from HuggingFace. 
Only change made currently is accessing Gemini API key instead of OpenAI as well as some minor changes made to interact with LangFuse API.

Looking to improve this project in the near future by:
- Allowing personal gmail api (or access) integration for classification
- Improving the classification task through Langfuse testing (or other framework)
- Deployment for clean usage and interaction 

Main skills displayed so far: Python, API integration, LangGraph
